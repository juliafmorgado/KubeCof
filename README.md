Your Kubernetes Coffee Chat ☸️☕️ presented by [@juliafmorgado](https://twitter.com/juliafmorgado)

The idea is to get a group of community members who have specific expertise in a certain area (DevOps, Cloud Native, Kubernetes etc) to appear on the show and share their knowledge.

If you want to be on the show to talk about any of the topics below feel free to open an issue.

- [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/juliafmorgado) the episodes <br>
- Listen to the episodes<br>
- [Subscribe](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/juliafmorgado) to the newsletter<br>
- [Contact Us](kubecof@gmail.com)

This repository will be used to keep track of the episodes and resources. I've used Michael Cade's [90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/main/README.md) as a roadmap for this project.
