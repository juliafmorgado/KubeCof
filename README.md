Your Kubernetes Coffee Chat ☸️☕️ presented by [@juliafmorgado](https://twitter.com/juliafmorgado)

The idea is to get a group of community members who have specific expertise in a certain area (DevOps, Cloud Native, Kubernetes etc) to appear on the show and share their knowledge.

This repository will be used to keep track of the episodes and resources.
